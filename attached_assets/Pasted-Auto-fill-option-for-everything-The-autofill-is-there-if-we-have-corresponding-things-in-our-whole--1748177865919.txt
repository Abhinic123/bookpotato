If it doesn't have more than 90 apartments, tell the requester that they can club their building with other buildings to reach the criteria. For the requester he will have to send the name, number of apartments and location (using gps) of the buildings with which he wants to club his building.

The numbers in this can be altered by the admin. Please create a few more things like this which might help populate the platform. Put them at the admins disposal.
